    "    2. `company_size`: The size of the company (numerical).\n",
    "    3. `job_title`: The job title of the employee (categorical).\n",

    "The problem is chosen as a <font color='#F3E5AB'>regression problem</font> because we aim to predict a continuous value, specifically the total compensation of an employee. Here are some reasons explaining why regression is an appropriate choice:\n",
    " 1. **Continuous Target Variable:** Total compensation is a continuous variable, not falling into fixed categories. When predicting an exact amount, regression is commonly used.\n",
    " 2. **Prediction of Specific Quantities:** In this context, we are interested in predicting a specific quantity, such as the exact income that an employee might have in a given scenario.\n",
    " 3. **Relationship between Features and Target:** Features such as job level, experience, domain, and base salary can significantly influence total compensation. This relationship can be well captured by regression models.\n",
    " 4. **Model Evaluation:** With regression models, we can use metrics like <font color='#F3E5AB'>Mean Squared Error (MSE)</font> or <font color='#F3E5AB'>R-squared</font> to evaluate prediction performance and measure the difference between predicted and actual values.\n",
    " 5. **Convenient for Model Interpretation:** Regression models provide a convenient way to interpret the impact of each feature on the target variable. This can be valuable in understanding why the model makes specific predictions."
