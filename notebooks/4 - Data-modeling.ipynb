    "- **Type of Problem:** Regression\n",
    "- **Objective:** Predict the total compensation of an employee based on various job-related features.\n",
    "- **Features:**\n",
    "    1. `company`: The company the employee works for (categorical).\n",
    "    2. `company_size`: The size of the company (numerical).\n",
    "    3. `job_title`: The job title of the employee (categorical).\n",
    "    4. `level`: The job level of the employee (categorical).\n",
    "    5. `domain`: The domain of the company or job (categorical).\n",
    "    6. `yoe_total`: Years of total work experience (numerical).\n",
    "    7. `yoe_at_company`: Years of work experience at the current company (numerical).\n",
    "    8. `base`: Base salary (numerical).\n",
    "    9. `stock`: Stock-related compensation (numerical).\n",
    "    10. `bonus`: Bonus amount (numerical).\n",
    "    11. `total_compensation`: **The target variable** - total compensation (numerical).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example Questions:**\n",
    "    - What is the expected total compensation for an employee with a certain job title, at a specific company, with a given level of experience?\n",
    "    - How much does the total compensation vary based on job level or company size?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Potential Use Cases:**\n",
    "    - Helping HR departments and employees understand the factors influencing compensation.\n",
    "    - Guiding salary negotiations by providing estimates based on relevant features."
